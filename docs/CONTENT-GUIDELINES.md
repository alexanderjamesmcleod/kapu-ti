Based on the [12 Guidelines from kupu.maori.nz](https://kupu.maori.nz/about/acknowledgements)

## The 12 Guidelines

We follow these principles for all Te Reo Māori content in Kapu Tī:

### 1. Start Simple
Always start with beginner/intermediate examples. Add more complex examples if desired.

**In Kapu Tī:** Card difficulty progresses from 2-card sentences to 5+ card sentences.

### 2. Everyday Contexts
Endeavour to use examples that people might use in everyday contexts.

**In Kapu Tī:** Focus on home, food, family, feelings, greetings - not obscure vocabulary.

### 3. Prefer Frequently-Used Kupu
Prefer kupu that are frequently used based on Mary Boyce's work, e.g., *pātai* rather than *ui*.

**In Kapu Tī:** Core deck uses high-frequency vocabulary first.

### 4. Variety of Grammatical Forms
Try to use a variety of grammatical forms between examples and within a group: questions, locatives, commands etc.

**In Kapu Tī:** Challenges include statements, questions, commands, and locatives.

### 5. Past Tense + Passive Voice
Avoid using a past tense with active sentences (as the past tends to sound better with the passive voice to native speakers).

**In Kapu Tī:** Past tense cards pair with passive sentence patterns.

### 6. Lowercase Unless Proper Noun
Put the kupu title and its translation in lowercase unless it's a proper noun, e.g., *tatari/tāria - wait*, but *Rātū - Tuesday*.

**In Kapu Tī:** Card text follows this convention.

### 7. Show Common Passive Forms
Show the most common passive form in the kupu title, e.g., *karanga(tia)*.

**In Kapu Tī:** Verb cards show passive suffix where applicable.

### 8. Verb AND Noun Usage
If a kupu is commonly used as a verb and as a noun e.g., *karanga*, show an example of it as a verb; optionally add an example with it as a noun.

**In Kapu Tī:** Cards indicate primary usage; examples show both.

### 9. Verbs with 'ki'
If a verb tends to take *ki*, use an active sentence to demonstrate this.

**In Kapu Tī:** Sentence patterns account for ki-taking verbs.

### 10. Linguist Review
Get work checked by a linguist.

**In Kapu Tī:** Future goal - partner with Te Reo experts.

### 11. Native Speaker Review
Get work checked by a native speaker of te Reo Māori.

**In Kapu Tī:** Future goal - community playtesting with native speakers.

### 12. Natural Māori First
When reviewing work, endeavour to make natural sounding sentences in te reo Māori rather than good translations of the English.

**In Kapu Tī:** This is our north star. Natural Māori > literal translation.
