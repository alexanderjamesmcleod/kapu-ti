# Kapu Ti - Feature Roadmap

**Vision:** A virtual whānau game night - see faces, hear voices, play cards together, have fun and learn Te Reo Māori at the same time!

---

## Core Philosophy

The game should feel like sitting at a real table, face-to-face, playing cards with friends and whānau. Not a solo app experience - a social, connected, learning experience.

---

## Feature Roadmap

### 1. Topic-Based Sentence Generation

**Status:** COMPLETE

**Concept:**
- Player 1 picks a random word or topic at the start of the game
- Sentence patterns are generated based on that word/topic
- Sentences morph into related sentences as the game progresses

**Example Flow:**
```
Player picks: "kai" (food)

Round 1: "He kai" → "A food"
Round 2 (morph): "Kei te kai au" → "I am eating"
Round 3 (morph): "Kei te matekai au" → "I am hungry"
Round 4 (morph): "Kei te tino matekai au" → "I am very hungry"
```

**Implementation:**
- Topic categories: Animals, Food, People, Places, Feelings, Actions
- Word association map: links words to related words
- Morphing rules: how sentences evolve (add intensifiers, change pronouns, add locations)

---

### 2. Turn Order via Māori Number Cards

**Status:** COMPLETE

**Concept:**
- At game start, each player is dealt a numbered card (tahi, rua, toru, whā, rima...)
- Highest number goes first
- Next highest goes second, etc.

**Māori Numbers (1-10):**
| Number | Māori | Pronunciation |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | tahi | tah-hee |
| 2 | rua | roo-ah |
| 3 | toru | taw-roo |
| 4 | whā | fah |
| 5 | rima | ree-mah |
| 6 | ono | oh-no |
| 7 | whitu | fee-too |
| 8 | waru | wah-roo |
| 9 | iwa | ee-wah |
| 10 | tekau | teh-kah-oo |

**Benefits:**
- Teaches numbers naturally through gameplay
- Fair, random turn order
- Thematic - cards look like real playing cards with Māori numerals

---

### 3. Unlimited Players + Dynamic Card Pool

**Status:** Planned

**Concept:**
- No artificial player limit
- As more players join, spawn more cards in the background
- Maintain healthy card-to-player ratio

**Ratio Rules:**
- Minimum 7 cards per player in deck
- As players join, auto-generate topic-appropriate cards
- Cards regenerate as they're used up

**Why this matters:**
- Big whānau game nights (10+ people)
- Classroom use (20-30 students)
- Community events

---

### 4. Live Video at the Table

**Status:** IN PROGRESS (UI ready, WebRTC pending)

**Concept:**
- See and talk to other players while playing
- Like sitting at a real table together
- Video feeds arranged around the "card table"

**Tech Options:**
- WebRTC (peer-to-peer) via `simple-peer` or `peerjs`
- Managed services: LiveKit, Daily.co, Twilio Video
- Hybrid: WebSocket for game state, WebRTC for video

**Layout Idea:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Video]    [Video]    [Video]      │  ← Other players
│                                     │
│         ┌─────────────┐             │
│         │ CARD TABLE  │             │  ← Shared game area
│         └─────────────┘             │
│                                     │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────┐    │
│  │        Your Hand            │    │  ← Your cards
│  └─────────────────────────────┘    │
│                                     │
│  [Your Video]                       │  ← Your camera
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Nice-to-haves:**
- Mute/unmute
- Camera on/off
- Virtual backgrounds
- Screen share for teaching

## Implementation Priority

1. ~~**Topic-based sentences**~~ DONE - 6 topics, sentence morphing, auto-distractors
2. ~~**Māori number turn order**~~ DONE - Full flow: deal → reveal → crown winner → pick topic
3. **Unlimited players** ← Next: Scale up with dynamic card pools
4. **Live video** ← IN PROGRESS: UI ready, needs WebRTC

## Technical Notes

### Topic-Based Sentence Generator

```typescript
interface Topic {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  maori: string;
  words: string[];           // Word IDs in this topic
  morphTargets: string[];    // Topics sentences can morph into
}

interface SentenceMorph {
  from: string;              // Pattern type
  to: string;                // Target pattern type
  trigger: 'round' | 'score' | 'player_choice';
  probability: number;       // 0-1 chance of morph
}

// Example topics
const TOPICS = {
  kai: {
    id: 'kai',
    name: 'Food',
    maori: 'Kai',
    words: ['n_kai', 'v_kai', 'adj_matekai', 'adj_makona'],
    morphTargets: ['feelings', 'actions']
  },
  whaanau: {
    id: 'whanau',
    name: 'Family',
    maori: 'Whānau',
    words: ['n_matua', 'n_tamaiti', 'n_tuahine', 'n_tungane'],
    morphTargets: ['people', 'feelings']
  }
};
```

### Dynamic Card Spawning

```typescript
interface CardPool {
  base: Card[];              // Starting cards
  spawned: Card[];           // Dynamically generated
  used: Card[];              // In discard/players' hands

  spawnForPlayer(): Card[];  // Generate cards for new player
  recycle(): void;           // Move used cards back to deck
  getAvailable(): Card[];    // Cards that can be drawn
}

// Spawn logic
function spawnCardsForTopic(topic: Topic, count: number): Card[] {
  // Generate cards from topic's word list
  // Ensure variety (nouns, verbs, adjectives)
  // Return balanced hand
}
```

## Success Metrics

- **Engagement:** Average session length > 15 minutes
- **Learning:** Players can build sentences without hints after 10 games
- **Social:** 50% of sessions are multiplayer
- **Scale:** Successfully handle 10+ player games

---

## Open Questions

1. **Video privacy:** How to handle player consent for video?
2. **Moderation:** How to handle inappropriate behavior in video?
3. **Accessibility:** How to make video optional without disadvantaging those who can't use it?
4. **Bandwidth:** How to handle low-bandwidth connections?
