## 9. Game Implementation Notes

### Rules for Valid Sentence Generation

1. **Match verb type to pattern:**
   - Transitive → needs object with `i`
   - Intransitive → no object, optional location with `ki`
   - Experience → object with `ki` (except kite uses `i`)

2. **Possession must match a/o category:**
   - Check possessed item against category rules
   - Use correct possessive form

3. **Tense markers are color Yellow:**
   - Include Kei te, Ka, I, Kua, E...ana

4. **Passive requires verb transformation:**
   - Add appropriate suffix to verb
   - Use `e` before agent

### Card Color Implications

When generating sentence patterns, ensure:
- Yellow cards (tense) come first
- Green cards (verb) follow tense
- Red cards (pronoun) in correct position
- Brown cards (preposition) match verb type requirements
- Gray cards (article) before nouns
- Blue cards (noun) after articles
